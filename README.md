# my-Java-file-sorter
 Simple Java File System Search Tool, platform agnostic, ui later.just a simple sample implementation of Recursioin. 
Platform agnostic.
Sample implementation of recursion.
Overview

This project offers a straightforward Java tool to recursively search and list files in any directory. Itâ€™s designed to be platform-independent and demonstrates how recursion works in Java for file system tasks.
Features

    Recursively searches directories for files and subdirectories
    Platform independent (works on Windows, macOS, Linux)
    Simple, clean code for learning about recursion in Java

Getting Started

    Clone the repository
    sh

git clone https://github.com/clint911/my-Java-file-sorter.git

Compile the Java files
sh

javac *.java

Run the application
sh

    java Main

    (Replace Main with your main class name if different.)

Usage

    The program will print out all files and directories it finds, starting from the specified directory.
    You can modify the code to filter by file type or name.

Next Steps

    Add a user interface (UI)
    Add more file filtering options
    Optimize for large file systems
